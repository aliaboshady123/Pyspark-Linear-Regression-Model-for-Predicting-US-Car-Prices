# Pyspark-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-US-Car-Prices

This repository contains a linear regression model that attempts to predict US car prices based on a dataset from Kaggle with 2500 cars.
The Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset

After getting the dataset, I did some alteration to it in which I changed slightly some of the string values.
This was done to remove any similarity between some of the values and the names of the columns.
Before this step was done, there were some errors.

<b>Files:</b>

<b>Coursework.ipynb</b> is the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code.

<b>USA_cars_datasets.csv</b> is the original unedited dataset that I got from Kaggle.

<b>newDataset.csv is the</b> new dataset that I manipulated, clean and preprocessed.
